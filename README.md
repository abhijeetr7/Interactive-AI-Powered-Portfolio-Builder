# Interactive-AI-Powered-Portfolio-Builder

What's Included:
Single index.html: All HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CDN and custom variables for themes), and JavaScript are in one file.

Responsive Layout: Uses flexbox and Tailwind CSS for a responsive design, adapting to different screen sizes.

Light/Dark Mode: A toggle button allows switching between themes, with preference saved in localStorage. There's also a basic "Glassmorphism" class you can apply.

Section Picker: Buttons for "About Me", "Projects", "Skills", "Testimonials", and "Contact" that activate corresponding sections in the live preview.

Live Preview Editor:

An <iframe> simulates the live portfolio, showing how changes would look.

Device view toggles (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) adjust the <iframe>'s size to simulate different screen sizes.

A simple text area allows editing the content of the "About Me", "Projects", "Skills", and "Testimonials" sections directly, with changes reflected in the preview upon saving.

AI Text Assistant (Placeholder): A "Write for Me (AI)" button is included. When clicked, it makes a fetch call to the Gemini API (using gemini-2.0-flash) with a dynamic prompt based on the selected section. The generated text is displayed and can be automatically put into the section editor.

GitHub Integration (Placeholder): A button to "Fetch GitHub Repos" is included. It simulates fetching data and displays mock repositories, also updating the "Projects" section in the preview.

EmailJS/SMTP REST Integration (Placeholder): The "Contact Me" section in the preview includes a basic form. Comments in the JavaScript explain how you would integrate a real email sending service.

Modal Message Box: Replaces alert() and confirm() for better user experience.

Firebase Integration Setup (Conceptual): Basic Firebase imports and initialization are included. The __app_id, __firebase_config, and __initial_auth_token global variables are used for authentication. Comments indicate where you would implement real-time collaboration features using Firestore. A user ID is displayed for potential collaborative use.

How to Use and Expand:
Run the HTML: Save the code as index.html and open it in a web browser.

Explore Features:

Click "Toggle Theme" to switch between light and dark modes.

Click "Desktop", "Tablet", "Mobile" to see responsive previews.

Select a section (e.g., "About Me"). Its content will appear in the "Selected Section Editor". Edit the text and click "Save Content" to see updates in the preview.

Click "Write for Me (AI)" to generate text for the selected section using the Gemini API.

Click "Fetch GitHub Repos" to see mock GitHub data populate.

Integrate Real APIs:

Gemini API: The apiKey in the aiWriteButton event listener is intentionally left empty (const apiKey = "";). In a real environment, Canvas will automatically provide the API key at runtime.

GitHub API: For actual GitHub integration, you'd replace the mock data with a fetch call to the GitHub API (e.g., https://api.github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/repos). Be mindful of API rate limits and consider using OAuth for more robust access.

EmailJS/SMTP.js: Follow the commented instructions in the JavaScript to integrate a service like EmailJS or your own backend API for contact form submissions.

Unsplash/Pixabay API: Implement fetch calls to these APIs to allow users to search and embed images.

Implement Drag & Drop: This is the most complex feature for a vanilla JS implementation. You would need to add draggable="true" to your section containers and implement event listeners for dragstart, dragover, drop, etc., to manage reordering.

Real-Time Collaboration: The Firebase setup is ready. You would uncomment and expand the Firestore listener functions (setupFirestoreListeners) to save and retrieve portfolio data in real-time, enabling multiple users to see changes instantly. Remember to configure Firestore security rules appropriately.

This robust foundation provides a great starting point for your interactive AI-powered portfolio builder!
